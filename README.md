# Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) using EasyOCR

This project is an implementation of Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) using EasyOCR, a Python library for optical character recognition (OCR). The project is built using OpenCV, imutils, matplotlib, and numpy.

## Requirements

To use this project, you need to have the following software installed on your system:
* Python 3.6 or higher
* OpenCV
* imutils
* matplotlib
* numpy
* EasyOCR

You can install these dependencies using pip:
```bash
  pip install opencv-python imutils matplotlib numpy easyocr
```
## Usage

To use the ALPR system, you need to run the alpr.py script. The script takes an image file containing a license plate as input and outputs the recognized license plate number.
```python
  python alpr.py --image <path-to-image-file>
```
